There is a problem with missing globals on my device.    
Despite these difficulties I tried to create a dasboard in KLWP.    
As a lover of Conky widgets for Linux, I created this light text dashboard in KLWP.    
The dashboard contains:    
- time
- date
- uptime
- alarm clock info 
- notifications
- weather, season, sunrise, sunset, zodiac, 
- system info: 
    - network
    - cpuc
    - ram
    - battery
    - storages
- quick launcher of favorite applications
